The right way to ask a question. 
==================================

We (me and your TA's) are in the business of helping you learn. 
Literally that is what we get a paycheck for. Thus we welcome your questions! 
However, and especially considering there are about 100 of you, please try to respect our role by 
asking questions the right way, and making efforts to find a solution on your own before you come to us. 
Turns out this workflow, which minimizes our effort, also maximizes your learning. 

If you come across an error message, in bash, Python, or in whichever software or language you are 
working, the first thing to do is to actually **read the error**. By that I mean I know there is a small sense of panic and defeat when you get an error, which makes you want to give up, feel helpless, and reach for assistance, but you should go beyond the word 'error' or the word 'fatal' and try and understand 
what the software is complaining about. Many pieces of software will offer details about the error, try to identify the culprit, and propose solutions to you. Git for example always gives you suggestions on what to do to address an error. 

The next thing is read the error **every time!**. Just because you still have an error after changing things up do not assume that 
it is the same error. Your code, just like mine, just like anyone's, is blooming with bugs like a warm summer night 
in NYC. Even when it works, and even when it gives the correct answer, it's still buggy, i promise! It is the course of the coder. As you solve one issue 
others may come up. Read the error message every time - it may be different then the first one. Sometimes the end of the error is the same but the body refers to a completely different ussue. As you can imagine it is quite annoying if you tell me the 
solution I gave you had no effect, and I go look into the problem and try and figure out another solution, and then 
it turns out I had in fact solved the problem days ago, and something else entirely was also wrong. 

Third: look around. Look on the *NYU classes* resources, announcements, board, to see if the problem is solved there
by your classmates. 
Then Google it, and look on http://stackoverflow.com/. Then, by all means, if you find solutions that are not clear to you, 
or you do not a find solution, come to us. 
In this order: your TA, your lab assistant (Graham), me. 

Lastly: give us all the information we need to help you. 
If you have an error on your terminal, tell us, by copy and paste 
and/or w a screenshot, what **the command** that causes the error is, 
and what **the full error** is. If it is code you are running, 
make sure we have access to the code to inspect it. Tell us which platform you are working on, 
Linux, Mac, Widows (gitbash or something else...). 
Otherwise it's gonna be garbage in -> garbage out. 
Look on http://stackoverflow.com/ to get a sense of how people 
write questions properly (look at the replies and see if the users complain about the format of the question). 

In summary, help us help you! 

Have a great day!
